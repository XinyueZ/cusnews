# About
Use (Faroo API)[http://www.faroo.com/hp/api/api.html#description] to fetch news feeds..
Also to demostrate new Google's (design-library)[http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/tools/support-library/features.html#design]. But I discard its own (FAB)[http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/support/design/widget/FloatingActionButton.html] instead by (fab project)[https://github.com/shell-software/fab]

# API
Enter API-Key in key.properties under resources directory.
Don't publish API-Key to public when fork the project to avoid abuse indeed.
